# How this knowledge base is organized

This repo is the knowledge base for **MIT 6.7960 — Deep Learning, Fall 2024**. It is read
by Cairn's in-extension AI chat, which fetches files over
raw.githubusercontent.com and follows relative markdown links.

## Layout

| Path                | Contents                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INDEX.md`          | Entry point. Course summary + annotated table of contents.    |
| `wiki/`             | Durable pages: one per lecture, plus cross-lecture topics.    |
| `raw/slides/`       | Full text of every slide, numbered. Slide N = PDF page N.     |
| `raw/transcripts/`  | Lecture transcripts with `[MM:SS]` paragraph marks.           |
| `raw/pdfs/`         | Slides and handouts downloaded from the course website.       |
| `raw/images/`       | Rendered figure slides, if any. Linked from the pages using them. |
| `sources.md`        | Crawl inventory: source URL → local file, fetch date.         |
| `TODO.md`           | Build tracker. Unchecked boxes are outstanding work.          |

## Conventions

- **INDEX.md is the front door.** The chat reads it first on every conversation.
  Every wiki page must appear there with a one-line description of what it holds.
  An unindexed page is effectively invisible.
- **Relative links only** (`[gradient descent](gradient-descent.md)`,
  `[slides](../raw/pdfs/lecture03.pdf)`). Absolute GitHub URLs break when the
  repo is renamed or forked.
- **Cite everything.** Claims trace back to a transcript timestamp or a slide.
- **Never invent course content.** If the transcript is unclear at some point,
  say so on the page. Do not fill the gap from outside knowledge — the chat
  presents these pages as authoritative material from this course.
- **Prose over fragments.** The chat quotes these pages to learners; bullet
  fragments quote badly.
- **Math in LaTeX**: `$...$` inline, `$$...$$` displayed. Renders both in
  Cairn's chat and on github.com. Never inside a code fence — that shows the
  source instead of the formula. Define each symbol on first use, and follow the
  course's own notation rather than a tidier one, since the learner is comparing
  the page against the lecturer's board.
- **Transcripts stay verbatim.** Captions spell notation out as speech ("theta
  sub j"); reconstructing it as $\theta_j$ belongs in `wiki/`, not in
  `raw/transcripts/`.

## Rebuilding

Built and updated by the `cairn-kb` skill. To add newly released lectures,
append entries to `TODO.md` and re-run the skill — it only does unchecked work.
